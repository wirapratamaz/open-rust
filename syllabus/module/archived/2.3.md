## Ownership Review

- Data in Rust programs have an owner
  - Owner is responsible for cleaning up data
    - Memory management
  - Only one owner (by default)
  - Functions, closures, structs, enums, and scopes are owners
- Data can be transferred (moved) from one owner to another
  - Function calls, variable reassignment, and closures
- Possible to “borrow” data from an owner
  - Owner still responsible for clean up

---

## Ownership Review - Example

```rust
fn place_item(freezer: &mut Freezer, item: FrozenItem) {
    freezer.contents.push(item);
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enum FrozenItem {
    IceCube,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Freezer {
    contents: Vec<FrozenItem>,
}

fn main() {
    let mut freezer = Freezer { contents: vec![] };
    let cube = FrozenItem::IceCube;
    place_item(&mut freezer, cube);
    // cube no longer available
}
```

---

## Lifetimes

- A way to inform the compiler that borrowed data will be valid at a specific point in time
- Needed for:
  - Storing borrowed data in structs or enums
  - Returning borrowed data from functions
- All data has a Lifetime
  - Most cases are elided

---

## Lifetime Syntax - struct

```rust
```

- Convention uses 'a, 'b, 'c
- 'static is reserved
  - 'static data stays in memory until the program terminates

---

## Lifetime Example - struct

```rust
enum Part {
    Bolt,
    Panel,
}

struct RobotArm<'a> {
    part: &'a Part,
}

struct AssemblyLine {
    parts: Vec<Part>,
}

fn main() {
    let line = AssemblyLine {
        parts: vec![Part::Bolt, Part::Panel],
    };

    let arm = RobotArm {
        part: &line.parts[0],
    };

    // arm no longer exists
}
```

---

## Lifetime Syntax - function

```rust
fn name<'a>(arg: &'a DataType) -> &'a DataType {}
```

---

## Solidifying understanding

- Lifetime annotations indicate that there exists some owned data that:
  - “Lives at least as long” as the borrowed data
  - “Outlives or outlasts” the scope of a borrow
  - “Exists longer than” the scope of a borrow
- Structures utilizing borrowed data must:
  - Always be created after the owner was created
  - Always be destroyed before the owner is destroyed

---

## Recap

- Lifetimes allow:
  - Borrowed data in a structure
  - Returning references from functions
- Lifetimes are the mechanism that tracks how long a piece of data resides in memory
- Lifetimes are usually elided, but can be specified manually
- Lifetimes will be checked by the compiler
