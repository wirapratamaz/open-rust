title: Module 2.6 - Parallel Execution | Thread
description: "Parallel Execution | Thread"
duration: 30 minutes
---

## Thread Basics

- A thread uses serial execution
  - Each line of code is executed one at a time
- Multicore CPUs can have multiple threads
  - Threads still executes serially
  - Each thread can execute different tasks
    - Better CPU utilization
- Threads are isolated from one another
  - Require additional work to communicate
  - Should communicate infrequently for performance reasons

---

## Working With Threads

- Threads are “spawned” (created)
  - Threads can spawn threads
  - Use the “main” thread for spawning in most cases
    - fn main() is the main thread
- Code is no longer executed line-by-line with threads
  - Requires careful planning
- When a thread completes work, it should be “joined” back into the main thread
  - Ensures that the thread has completed

## Thread Lifetime

TODO

---

## Thread Memory

- Threads have “thread-local” memory
  - Owned by the thread
  - Only accessible in the thread
- Data can be copied or moved into threads
  - Can be done when thread created
  - Becomes thread-local

## Channels

- One-way communication between threads
  - Message passing
  - Sender and Receiver
- Can have limited or unlimited capacity
- crossbeam-channel crate
  - Use docs.rs website to view documentation for crates

```rust
[dependencies]
crossbeam-channel = "*"
```

---

## Message Passing

- enum commonly used for messages
  - match allows easy message handling
- Guaranteed in-order delivery
- Can be blocking or non-blocking
  - Block on Sender: Channel full
  - Block on Receiver: No messages
  - Behavior determined by function, not by channel

## Channels & Threads

## Example

```rust
use crossbeam_channel::unbounded;

let (sender, receiver) = unbounded();

sender.send("Hello, channel!")?;

match receiver.recv() {
    Ok(msg) => println!("{}", msg),
    Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
}
```

---

## Threaded Example

```rust
use crossbeam_channel::unbounded;
use std::thread;

let (s, r) = unbounded();

let handle = thread::spawn(move || match r.recv() {
    Ok(msg) => println!("Thread: {}", msg),
    Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
});

s.send("Hello from main!")?;
handle.join()?;
```

---

## Multi-threaded Example

```rust
use crossbeam_channel::unbounded;
use std::thread;

let (s, r1) = unbounded();
let r2 = r1.clone();

let handle1 = thread::spawn(move || match r1.recv() {
    Ok(msg) => println!("Thread1: {}", msg),
    Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
});

let handle2 = thread::spawn(move || match r2.recv() {
    Ok(msg) => println!("Thread2: {}", msg),
    Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
});

s.send("Hello from main!")?;
s.send("Hello from main!")?;
handle1.join()?;
handle2.join()?;
```

---

## Result

```rust
Thread1: Hello from main!
Thread2: Hello from main!
```
