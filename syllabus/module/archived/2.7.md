title: Module 2.7 - Shared Ownership | Smart Pointers
description: "IShared Ownership | Smart Pointer"
duration: 30 minutes
---

## Smart Pointers

- Allow multiple owners of data
- Reference counted – “Rc”
  - Data deleted only when last owner is dropped
- Atomic reference counted – “Arc”
  - Safe to use with multiple threads

---

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Vehicle {
    vin: String,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Door {
    vehicle: Rc<Vehicle>,
}

let car = Rc::new(Vehicle {
    vin: "123".to_owned(),
});

let left_door = Door {
    vehicle: Rc::clone(&car),
};

let right_door = Door {
    vehicle: Rc::clone(&car),
};

drop(car);

println!("vehicle = {:?}", left_door.vehicle);
```

---

## Interior Mutability

- Mutable data is sometimes problematic
  - Compiler errors, ownership issues, etc.
- Possible to create permanently mutable memory
  - Less restrictive than compiler
    - Trade-offs in implementation & performance

---

## Cell

- Permanently mutable memory location
  - Can always be mutated, even if the containing structure is immutable
- Accessing Cell data always results in a move or copy
- Data should be copy-able
  - #[derive(Clone, Copy)]
  - Inefficient for large data types
    - Limit to numbers and booleans
- Prefer mut

---

## Example

```rust
use std::cell::Cell;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Book {
    signed: Cell<bool>,
}

impl Book {
    fn sign(&self) {
        self.signed.set(true);
    }

    fn signed(&self) -> bool {
        self.signed.get()
    }
}

let my_book = Book {
    signed: Cell::new(false),
};

println!("signed: {}", my_book.signed());
my_book.sign();
println!("signed: {}", my_book.signed());

//signed: false
//signed: true
```

---

## RefCell

- Permanently mutable memory location
  - Can always be mutated, even if the containing structure is immutable
- Accessing RefCell data always results in a borrow
  - Efficient data access (compared to Cell)
  - Borrow checked at runtime
    - Will panic at runtime if rules are broken
    - Only one mutable borrow at a time
- Prefer &mut
- Not thread-safe

---

## Example - Borrow

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

struct Person {
    name: RefCell<String>,
}

let name = "Amy".to_owned();
let person = Person {
    name: RefCell::new(name),
};

let name = person.name.borrow();
```

---

## Example - Mutation

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

struct Person {
    name: RefCell<String>,
}

let name = "Amy".to_owned();
let person = Person {
    name: RefCell::new(name),
};

let mut name = person.name.borrow_mut();
*name = "Tim".to_owned();

person.name.replace("Tim".to_owned());
```

---

## Example - Mutation

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

struct Person {
    name: RefCell<String>,
}

let name = "Amy".to_owned();
let person = Person {
    name: RefCell::new(name),
};

let mut name = person.name.borrow_mut();
*name = "Tim".to_owned();

person.name.replace("Tim".to_owned());
```

---

## Example – Checked Borrow

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

struct Person {
    name: RefCell<String>,
}

let name = "Amy".to_owned();
let person = Person {
    name: RefCell::new(name),
};

let name: Result<_, _> = person.name.try_borrow();
let name: Result<_, _> = person.name.try_borrow_mut();
```

---

## Shared Data w/Threading

- Threads execute non-deterministically
  - Can read/write at random times
- Multiple threads can work with the same data
  - Data can become corrupted easily
    - Difficult to work with threads

---

## Data Corruption

    Stage 1 - Initial State:
    L: |LLLL|
    S: |SSSS|
       |SSSS|
    A: ^
    
    Stage 2 - After adding more thread-local data:
    L: |LLLL|
       |LLLB|
    S: |SSSS|
       |SSSS|
    A: ^    B: ^
    
    Stage 3 - Data Corruption (shared data 'S' is now 'XXXX' to show corruption):
    L: |LLLL|
       |LLLB|
    S: |XXXX|
       |XXXX|
    A: ^    B: ^

Notes:

- 'L' represents thread-local data.
- 'S' represents shared data that is fine.
- 'B' is a new thread-local block added.
- 'A' and 'B' at the bottom denote the active areas of thread-local data for different threads.
- 'XXXX' represents the corrupted shared data.
- The '^' character points to the active area of the data for a particular thread.

---

## Synchronization

- Data needs to be synchronized for safe access
- Common synchronization primitive is a Mutex
  - Mutually Exclusive lock
- Uses atomic operations to ensure that data is only accessed by one thread at a time
- Atomic operations are “all or nothing” operations, enforced by the CPU
  - Data stays consistent

---

## Mutex

- Mutexes wrap data, making data mutually exclusive
  - Only one thread can access at a time
  - All other threads will wait until finished
- Mutexes cannot be shared among threads
  - Wrap with a smart pointer (Arc)
  - Share the Arc among threads
- Use parking_lot crate for a Mutex
  - Better API & performance than stdlib

---

## How Mutex Works: Locks

    Thread A        Thread B
      |                |
      |                |
      |---Lock---|     |
      |          |     |
      |          |     |
      |---Unlock-|     |
      |                |
      |                |---Try Lock (fails, Thread A has the lock)
      |                |       |
      |                |---Wait---
      |                |       |
      |                |---Lock---|
      |                |          |
      |                |          |
      |                |---Unlock-|

Notes:

- Vertical bars | represent the progress over time for both Thread A and Thread B.
- "Lock" is where Thread A starts its critical section and acquires the mutex lock.
- "Unlock" is where Thread A releases the mutex lock.
- "Try Lock" shows Thread B attempting to acquire the mutex lock but it can't because Thread A has it.
- "Wait" represents Thread B waiting for the mutex to become available.
- After Thread A unlocks, Thread B acquires the lock ("Lock") and then eventually releases it ("Unlock").

---

## Example

```rust
use parking_lot::Mutex;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

struct Counter(usize);

let counter = Counter(0);
let shared_counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(counter));

let thread_1_counter = Arc::clone(&shared_counter);
let thread_2_counter = shared_counter.clone();
```

---

## Example

```rust
let thread_1 = thread::spawn(move || {
    let mut counter = thread_1_counter.lock();
    counter.0 += 1;
});

let thread_2 = thread::spawn(move || {
    let mut counter = thread_2_counter.lock();
    counter.0 += 1;
});

thread_1.join().and_then(|_| thread_2.join());
println!("{}", shared_counter.lock().0);
```

---

## Deadlock

- A deadlock is a situation where locks are waiting on one another
  - Threads become “stuck” and are unable to continue
- Deadlocks can occur when:
  - Using multiple locks
  - Recursing while taking a lock
  - Locking the same lock twice

---

## Recursive Deadlock Example

```rust
use parking_lot::Mutex;

fn recurse(
    data: Rc<Mutex<u32>>,
    remaining: usize,
) -> usize {
    let mut locked = data.lock();
    match remaining {
        rem if rem == 0 => 0,
        rem => recurse(Rc::clone(&data), rem - 1),
    }
}
```

---

## Fix Deadlock - ReentrantMutex

```rust
use parking_lot::ReentrantMutex;

fn recurse(
    data: Rc<ReentrantMutex<u32>>,
    remaining: usize,
) -> usize {
    let mut locked = data.lock();
    match remaining {
        rem if rem == 0 => 0,
        rem => recurse(Rc::clone(&data), rem - 1),
    }
}
```

---

## Threaded Deadlock Example

```rust
type ArcAccount = Arc<Mutex<Account>>;

struct Account {
    balance: i64,
}

fn transfer(from: ArcAccount, to: ArcAccount, amount: i64) {
    let mut from = from.lock();
    let mut to = to.lock();
    from.balance -= amount;
    to.balance += amount;
}

let t1 = thread::spawn(move || {
    transfer(a, b, 500);
});
let t2 = thread::spawn(move || {
    transfer(b, a, 800);
});
```

---

## Fix Deadlock – Retry On Failure

```rust
fn transfer(from: ArcAccount, to: ArcAccount, amount: i64) {
    loop {
        if let Some(mut from) = from.try_lock() {
            if let Some(mut to) = to.try_lock() {
                from.balance -= amount;
                to.balance += amount;
                return;
            }
        }
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(2));
    }
}
```

---

## Thread Contention / Backoff

```rust
use backoff::ExponentialBackoff;

fn transfer(from: ArcAccount, to: ArcAccount, amount: i64) {
    let op = || {
        if let Some(mut from) = from.try_lock() {
            if let Some(mut to) = to.try_lock() {
                from.balance -= amount;
                to.balance += amount;
                return Ok(());
            }
        }
        Err(())?
    };
    let backoff = ExponentialBackoff::default();
    backoff::retry(backoff, op);
}
```
