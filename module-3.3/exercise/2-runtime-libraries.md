# Exercise 2: Runtime Libraries

## Objective
Explore runtime libraries (frame_* and pallet_*) and understand their roles in Substrate development.

## Instructions

1. For each of the following runtime libraries, write a brief description of its purpose:
   - `frame_system`: 
   - `frame_support`: 
   - `frame_executive`: 
   - `pallet_balances`: 
   - `pallet_timestamp`: 

2. In a Substrate runtime, explain the relationship between:
   - FRAME (Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities)
   - Pallets
   - Runtime

3. Create a simple Cargo.toml dependency section for a runtime that includes the following: 
   - frame_system
   - frame_support
   - pallet_balances
   - Ensure it's configured correctly for Wasm compilation

4. What would you need to add to integrate a consensus mechanism like Aura or Babe into your runtime?
