# Exercise 1: Substrate Library Categories

## Objective
Understand the various library categories in Substrate and their naming conventions.

## Instructions

1. Match each library prefix with its correct category:
   - `frame_*`: 
   - `sp_*`: 
   - `sc_*`: 
   - `pallet_*`: 
   - `cumulus_*`: 

2. For each of the following libraries, identify which category they belong to:
   - `frame_system`
   - `sp_runtime`
   - `sc_service`
   - `pallet_balances`
   - `cumulus_pallet_xcm`

3. Why is it important to understand these different categories when developing with Substrate?

4. If you were building a custom runtime module for managing digital assets, what naming convention would you use?
