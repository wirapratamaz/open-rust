# Exercise 3: Primitive Libraries

## Objective
Understand primitive libraries (sp_*) that provide the communication layer between the node and runtime.

## Instructions

1. For each of the following primitive libraries, explain its primary purpose:
   - `sp_runtime`: 
   - `sp_core`: 
   - `sp_std`: 
   - `sp_io`: 

2. Why are primitive libraries essential for Substrate blockchain development?

3. What is the significance of `no_std` compatibility in the context of `sp_std`? Why is this important for blockchain runtime development?

4. If you needed to implement a custom cryptographic operation in your Substrate runtime, which primitive library would most likely be involved?

5. How do primitive libraries differ from runtime libraries in terms of:
   - Where they execute (node vs runtime)
   - Their compilation targets
