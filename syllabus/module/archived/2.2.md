## Traits

- A way to specify that some functionality exists
- Used to standardize functionality across multiple different types
  - Standardization permits functions to operate on multiple different types
    - Code deduplication

---

## Example

```rust
trait Noise {
    fn make_noise(&self);
}

fn hello(noisy: impl Noise) {
    noisy.make_noise();
}

fn main() {
    hello(Person {});
    hello(Dog {});
}

struct Person;
impl Noise for Person {
    fn make_noise(&self) {
        println!("hello");
    }
}

struct Dog;
impl Noise for Dog {
    fn make_noise(&self) {
        println!("woof");
    }
}

```

---

## Example

```rust
trait Racer {
    fn go(&self);
    fn is_ready(&self) -> bool;
    fn checkpoint(&self, position: i32);
}
```

---

## What Are Generic Functions?

- A way to write a function that can have a single parameter with multiple data types
- Trait is used as function parameter instead of data
type
  - Function depends on existence of functions declared by trait
- Less code to write
  - Automatically works when new data types are introduced

---

## Quick Review: Traits

```rust
trait Move {
    fn move_to(&self, x: i32, y: i32);
}

struct Snake;
impl Move for Snake {
    fn move_to(&self, x: i32, y: i32) {
        println!("slither to ({},{})", x, y);
    }
}

struct Grasshopper;
impl Move for Grasshopper {
    fn move_to(&self, x: i32, y: i32) {
        println!("hop to ({},{})", x, y);
    }
}
```

---

## Quick Review: Traits

```rust
trait Move {
    fn move_to(&self, x: i32, y: i32);
}

fn make_move(thing: impl Move, x: i32, y: i32) {
    thing.move_to(x, y);
}

let python = Snake {};
make_move(python, 1, 1);

// Output:
// slither to (1,1)

```

---

## Generic Syntax

```rust
fn function<T: Trait1, U: Trait2>(param1: T, param2: U) {
    /* body */
}
```

---

## Generic Syntax

```rust
fn function<T: Trait1, U: Trait2>(param1: T, param2: U) {
    /* body */
}

fn function<T, U>(param1: T, param2: U) 
    where T: Trait1 + Trait2,
          U: Trait1 + Trait2 + Trait3,
{
    /* body */
}

```

---

## Generic Example

```rust
fn make_move(thing: impl Move, x: i32, y: i32) {
    thing.move_to(x, y);
}

fn make_move<T: Move>(thing: T, x: i32, y: i32) {
    thing.move_to(x, y);
}

```

---

## Generic Example

```rust
fn make_move(thing: impl Move, x: i32, y: i32) {
    thing.move_to(x, y);
}

fn make_move<T>(thing: T, x: i32, y: i32)
where
    T: Move,
{
    thing.move_to(x, y);
}

```

---

## Which syntax to choose?

```rust
fn function(param1: impl Trait1, param2: impl Trait2) {
    /* body */
}

impl Move for Grasshopper {
    fn move_to(&self, x: i32, y: i32) {
        println!("hop to ({},{})", x, y);
    }
}
```

---

## Which syntax to choose?

```rust
fn function(param1: impl Trait1, param2: impl Trait2) {
    /* body */
}

fn function<T: Trait1, U: Trait2>(param1: T, param2: U) {
    /* body */
}
```

---

## Which syntax to choose?

```rust
fn function(param1: impl Trait1, param2: impl Trait2) {
    /* body */
}

fn function<T: Trait1, U: Trait2>(param1: T, param2: U) {
    /* body */
}

fn function<T, U>(param1: T, param2: U)
where
    T: Trait1 + Trait2,
    U: Trait1 + Trait2 + Trait3,
{
    /* body */
}
```

---

## Details - Monomorphization

```rust
trait Move {
    fn move_to(&self, x: i32, y: i32);
}

fn make_move<T: Move>(thing: T, x: i32, y: i32) {
    thing.move_to(x, y);
}

make_move(Snake {}, 1, 1);
make_move(Grasshopper {}, 3, 3);
```

---

## Details - Monomorphization

```rust
trait Move {
    fn move_to(&self, x: i32, y: i32);
}

fn make_move<T: Move>(thing: T, x: i32, y: i32) {
    thing.move_to(x, y);
}

make_move(Snake {}, 1, 1);
make_move(Grasshopper {}, 3, 3);

fn make_move(thing: Snake, x: i32, y: i32) {
    thing.move_to(x, y);
}

fn make_move(thing: Grasshopper, x: i32, y: i32) {
    thing.move_to(x, y);
}

```

---

## Generic Structures

- Store data of any type within a structure
  - Trait bounds restrict the type of data the structure can utilize
    - Also known as “generic constraints”
- Useful when making your own data collections
- Reduces technical debt as program expands
  - New data types can utilize generic structures and be easily integrated into the program

---

## Conceptual Example

- Generic structure for template rendering
  - Template Source Paths
  - Variable substitution data
  - Generic render target
    - File
    - Terminal
    - Image
    - Bytes

---

## Syntax

```rust
struct Name<T: Trait1 + Trait2, U: Trait3> {
    field1: T,
    field2: U,
}

struct Name<T, U>
where
    T: Trait1 + Trait2,
    U: Trait3,
{
    field1: T,
    field2: U,
}
```

---

## Example - Definition

```rust
trait Seat {
    fn show(&self);
}

struct Ticket<T: Seat> {
    location: T,
}
```

---

## Example – Types of seating

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
enum ConcertSeat {
    FrontRow,
    MidSection(u32),
    Back(u32),
}

impl Seat for ConcertSeat {
    fn show(&self) { /* ... */ }
}

#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
enum AirlineSeat {
    BusinessClass,
    Economy,
    FirstClass,
}

impl Seat for AirlineSeat {
    fn show(&self) { /* ... */ }
}
```

---

## Example – Usage with single type

```rust
trait Seat {
    fn show(&self);
}

struct Ticket<T: Seat> {
    location: T,
}

fn ticket_info(ticket: Ticket<AirlineSeat>) {
    ticket.location.show();
}

let airline = Ticket { location: AirlineSeat::FirstClass };
ticket_info(airline);
```

---

## Example – Usage with generic type

```rust
trait Seat {
    fn show(&self);
}

struct Ticket<T: Seat> {
    location: T,
}

fn ticket_info<T: Seat>(ticket: Ticket<T>) {
    ticket.location.show();
}

let airline = Ticket { location: AirlineSeat::FirstClass };
let concert = Ticket { location: ConcertSeat::FrontRow };
ticket_info(airline);
ticket_info(concert);

```

---

## Details

```rust
struct Ticket<T: Seat> {
    location: T,
}

fn ticket_info<T: Seat>(ticket: Ticket<T>) {
    ticket.location.show();
}

let airline = Ticket { location: AirlineSeat::FirstClass };
let concert = Ticket { location: ConcertSeat::FrontRow };
ticket_info(airline);
ticket_info(concert);
```

---

## Details – Behind the scenes

```rust
struct AirlineTicket {
    location: AirlineSeat,
}

struct ConcertTicket {
    location: ConcertSeat,
}

fn airline_ticket_info(ticket: AirlineTicket) {
    ticket.location.show();
}

fn concert_ticket_info(ticket: ConcertTicket) {
    ticket.location.show();
}
```

---

## Details – Heterogeneous vector

```rust
let airline = Ticket { location: AirlineSeat::FirstClass };
let concert = Ticket { location: ConcertSeat::FrontRow };
ticket_info(airline);
ticket_info(concert);

let tickets = vec![airline, concert];

error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> src/main.rs:89:33
   |
89 |     let tickets = vec![airline, concert];
   |                                 ^^^^^^^ expected enum `AirlineSeat`, found enum `ConcertSeat`
   = note: expected type `Ticket<AirlineSeat>`
              found struct `Ticket<ConcertSeat>`
```

---

## Implementing Functionality

- Generic implementation
  - Implements functionality for any type that can be used with the structure
- Concrete implementation
  - Implements functionality for only the type specified

---

## Concrete Implementation - Setup

```rust
trait Game {
    fn name(&self) -> String;
}

enum BoardGame {
    Chess,
    Monopoly,
}

impl Game for BoardGame {
    // Implementation would go here
}

enum VideoGame {
    PlayStation,
    Xbox,
}

impl Game for VideoGame {
    // Implementation would go here
}
```

---

## Concrete Implementation - Usage

```rust
struct PlayRoom<T: Game> {
    game: T,
}

impl PlayRoom<BoardGame> {
    pub fn cleanup(&self) { /* ... */ }
}

// The rest of the code is using the PlayRoom struct with different types of games.
let video_room = PlayRoom {
    game: VideoGame::Xbox,
};

let board_room = PlayRoom {
    game: BoardGame::Monopoly,
};

// Assuming similar cleanup method implementation for VideoGame as for BoardGame
board_room.cleanup();
video_room.cleanup();
```

---

## Concrete Implementation - Error

```rust
struct PlayRoom<T: Game> {
    // ...
}

// ...

video_room.cleanup();
//     ^^^^^^^ method not found in `PlayRoom<VideoGame>`
```

---

## Generic Implementation - Syntax

```rust
struct Name<T: Trait1 + Trait2, U: Trait3> {
    field1: T,
    field2: U,
}

impl<T: Trait1 + Trait2, U: Trait3> Name<T, U> {
    fn func(&self, arg1: T, arg2: U) { }
}
```

---

## Generic Implementation - Syntax

```rust
struct Name<T, U>
where
    T: Trait1 + Trait2,
    U: Trait3,
{
    field1: T,
    field2: U,
}

impl<T, U> Name<T, U>
where
    T: Trait1 + Trait2,
    U: Trait3,
{
    fn func(&self, arg1: T, arg2: U) { }
}
```

---

## Generic Implementation - Example

```rust
trait Game {
    fn name(&self) -> String;
}

struct PlayRoom<T: Game> {
    game: T,
}

impl<T: Game> PlayRoom<T> {
    pub fn game_info(&self) {
        println!("{}", self.game.name());
    }
}
```

---

## Generic Implementation - Usage

```rust
impl<T: Game> PlayRoom<T> {
    pub fn game_info(&self) { /* ... */ }
}

let video_room = PlayRoom {
    game: VideoGame::Xbox,
};

let board_room = PlayRoom {
    game: BoardGame::Monopoly,
};

video_room.game_info();
board_room.game_info();
```

---

## Intermediate memory refresh

- All data has a memory address
  - Addresses determine the location of data in memory
- Offsets can be used to access adjacent addresses
  - Also called indexes/indices

---

## Stack

- Data placed sequentially
- Limited space
- All variables stored on the stack
  - Not all data
- Very fast to work with
  - Offsets to access

---

## Stack Visualization

TODO

---

## Heap

- Data placed algorithmically
  - Slower than stack
- Unlimited space (RAM/disk limits apply)
- Uses pointers
  - Pointers are a fixed size
  - usize data type
- Vectors & HashMaps stored on the heap
  -All dynamically sized collections

---

## Heap Visual w/Pointers on Stack

TODO

---

## Example

```rust
struct Entry {
    id: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let data = Entry { id: 5 };
    let data_ptr: Box<Entry> = Box::new(data);
    let data_stack = *data_ptr;
}
```

---

## Sized Error

```rust
error[E0746]: return type cannot have an unboxed trait object
 --> src/main.rs:1:16
  |
1 | fn sample() -> Fn() {
  |                ^^^ doesn't have a size known at compile-time
  |
  = note: for information on `impl Trait`, see <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html#returning-types-that-implement-traits>
```

---

## Trait Object Basics

- Dynamically allocated object
  - “Runtime generics”
    - More flexible than generics
    - “Dynamic Dispatch” vs “Static Dispatch”
- Allows mixed types in a collection
  - Easier to work with similar data types
  - Polymorphic program behavior
    - Dynamically change program behavior at runtime
    - Easily add new behaviors just by creating a new struct
- Small performance penalty

---

## Creating a Trait Object

```rust
trait Clicky {
    fn click(&self);
}

struct Keyboard;

impl Clicky for Keyboard {
    fn click(&self) {
        println!("click clack");
    }
}
```

---

## Creating a Trait Object

```rust
let keeb = Keyboard;
let keeb_obj: &dyn Clicky = &keeb;

let keeb: &dyn Clicky = &Keyboard;

let keeb: Box<dyn Clicky> = Box::new(Keyboard);
```

---

## Trait Object Parameter - Borrow

```rust
fn borrow_clicky(obj: &dyn Clicky) {
    obj.click();
}

let keeb = Keyboard;
borrow_clicky(&keeb);
```

---

## Trait Object Parameter - Move

```rust
fn move_clicky(obj: Box<dyn Clicky>) {
    obj.click();
}

let keeb = Box::new(Keyboard);
move_clicky(keeb);
```

---

## Heterogeneous Vector

```rust
struct Mouse;

impl Clicky for Mouse {
    fn click(&self) {
        println!("click");
    }
}

let keeb: Box<dyn Clicky> = Box::new(Keyboard);
let mouse: Box<dyn Clicky> = Box::new(Mouse);
let clickers = vec![keeb, mouse];
```

---

## Heterogeneous Vector

```rust
fn make_clicks(clickies: Vec<Box<dyn Clicky>>) {
    for clicker in clickies {
        clicker.click();
    }
}

let keeb = Box::new(Keyboard);
let mouse = Box::new(Mouse);
let clickers: Vec<Box<dyn Clicky>> = vec![keeb, mouse];

make_clicks(clickers);
```
