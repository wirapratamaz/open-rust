# Substrate FRAME System
## Modular Architecture & Trait System

---

# Key Topics

- Modular Architecture of Substrate FRAME
- Defining Shared Behavior with Traits
- Common Rust Libraries in Substrate Node

---

# Modular Architecture Overview

- Substrate FRAME uses **pallets** - self-contained modules for specific functionality
- Each pallet is developed independently
- Pallets specify requirements through `Config` trait
- Runtime implements and integrates pallets together

```rust
pub trait Config {
    type Event: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::Event>;
    type Currency: Currency<Self::AccountId>;
    // Other requirements...
}
```

---

# Composition Model

- Pallets are composed at the runtime level
- Runtime aggregates pallets using `construct_runtime!` macro
- Enables flexible customization and upgradeability
- Pallets can be swapped or modified without affecting entire system

```rust
construct_runtime!(
    pub enum Runtime where
        Block = Block,
        NodeBlock = opaque::Block,
        UncheckedExtrinsic = UncheckedExtrinsic
    {
        System: frame_system,
        Balances: pallet_balances,
        // Other pallets...
    }
);
```

---

# Defining Shared Behavior with Traits

- Traits define shared behaviors across pallets
- Enable loose coupling between modules
- Runtime provides implementations for traits
- Allows pallets to share functionality without tight coupling

---

# Common Traits Example: Currency

```rust
pub trait Currency<AccountId> {
    type Balance: Member + AtLeast32BitUnsigned + FullCodec + Copy + MaybeSerializeDeserialize + Debug + Default;
    
    fn total_balance(who: &AccountId) -> Self::Balance;
    fn transfer(source: &AccountId, dest: &AccountId, value: Self::Balance) -> DispatchResult;
    // Other methods...
}
```

- Abstraction over fungible assets system
- Manages balances and transfers
- Implemented by pallets like `pallet_balances`

---

# Trait Dependencies

- Pallets declare trait dependencies through `Config`
- Runtime connects pallets by implementing trait requirements
- Example: A custom pallet using Currency

```rust
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
    type Event: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::Event>;
    type Currency: Currency<Self::AccountId>;
}

impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
    // Can use T::Currency throughout the pallet
}
```

# More Common Traits

| **Trait Name**          | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Currency`              | Abstraction over a fungible assets system, managing balances and transfers.      |
| `LockableCurrency`      | Extends `Currency` for locking funds, useful in staking and voting systems.      |
| `ReservableCurrency`    | Allows reserving balances for specific purposes, enhancing economic flexibility. |
| `OnRuntimeUpgrade`      | Defines logic to run prior to runtime upgrades, ensuring compatibility.          |
| `GenesisBuild`          | Sets up initial state during genesis, defining pallet configuration.            |

# Common Rust Libraries in Substrate

## Runtime Libraries (frame_* and pallet_*)
- **frame_system**: Core runtime functions
- **frame_support**: Pallet development utilities
- **pallet_balances**: Account balance management

## Primitive Libraries (sp_*)
- **sp_runtime**: Runtime types and traits
- **sp_core**: Essential primitives like cryptography

## Node Service Libraries (sc_*)
- **sc_service**: Networking and communication
- **sc_cli**: Command-line interfaces
- **sc_executor**: Runtime execution

---

# Code Example: Runtime Implementation

```rust
impl my_pallet::Config for Runtime {
    type Event = Event;
    type Currency = Balances;  // Using Balances pallet for Currency trait
    type MaxLocks = ConstU32<50>;
}
```

- Runtime connects pallets by implementing trait requirements
- Uses other pallets to fulfill trait requirements
- Enables loose coupling and modular composition

---

# Benefits of Trait-Based Architecture

1. **Modularity**: Pallets can be swapped or upgraded independently
2. **Interoperability**: Pallets interact through well-defined interfaces 
3. **Reusability**: Implementations can be shared across different pallets
4. **Flexibility**: Different trait implementations for different scenarios
5. **Testability**: Easier to create mock implementations for testing

# Summary

- Substrate FRAME uses pallets for modular blockchain construction
- Traits define shared behaviors and enable loose coupling
- Pallets specify dependencies via `Config` trait
- Runtime composes pallets by implementing their `Config` traits
- Common libraries include frame_*, sp_*, and sc_* crates
- This architecture enables flexible and customizable blockchain development
