# Answer: Node Service Libraries

## 1. Node service library functions:

   - `sc_service`: Provides the core functionality for a Substrate node, including networking, transaction pool management, and the overall service architecture. It's responsible for coordinating all the node's components.
   
   - `sc_cli`: Implements the command-line interface for Substrate nodes, handling command parsing, configuration, and providing tools for interacting with the node through the terminal.
   
   - `sc_executor`: Responsible for executing the runtime code, managing the transition between native and Wasm execution, and handling the communication between the node and the runtime.
   
   - `sc_network`: Handles peer-to-peer communication, including peer discovery, connection management, and block and transaction propagation across the network.
   
   - `sc_consensus`: Implements the consensus mechanisms at the node level, working with the corresponding runtime pallets to reach agreement on the chain state.

## 2. Cargo.toml for node project:

```toml
[dependencies]
# Node-specific dependencies
sc_service = { version = "0.10.0-dev", git = "https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git", branch = "polkadot-v0.9.42" }
sc_cli = { version = "0.10.0-dev", git = "https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git", branch = "polkadot-v0.9.42" }
sc_executor = { version = "0.10.0-dev", git = "https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git", branch = "polkadot-v0.9.42" }
sc_network = { version = "0.10.0-dev", git = "https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git", branch = "polkadot-v0.9.42" }
sc_consensus = { version = "0.10.0-dev", git = "https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git", branch = "polkadot-v0.9.42" }
sc_transaction_pool = { version = "4.0.0-dev", git = "https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git", branch = "polkadot-v0.9.42" }

# Consensus-specific node libraries (example for Aura)
sc_consensus_aura = { version = "0.10.0-dev", git = "https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git", branch = "polkadot-v0.9.42" }
```

## 3. Relationship between node and runtime:

**Node implementation:**
- Runs as a native binary on the host machine
- Handles networking, storage, and external communication
- Coordinates block production and finalization
- Manages the transaction pool and peer connections
- Executes the runtime code

**Runtime implementation:**
- Defines the state transition function (business logic)
- Determines how the blockchain state changes
- Compiled to Wasm for portability and on-chain upgrades
- Contains logic for transaction validation and block production

**Communication between node and runtime:**
- Through a defined API layer using primitive libraries (`sp_*`)
- The node calls the runtime via the executor (`sc_executor`)
- The runtime accesses node functionality through host functions (`sp_io`)
- Data is passed using well-defined types in `sp_runtime`
- The compiler enforces compatibility through trait bounds and type checking

This separation enables the unique forkless runtime upgrade capability of Substrate, where the runtime (business logic) can be upgraded without changing the node implementation.

## 4. Debugging block production:

If debugging issues with block production, these node service libraries would be most relevant:

- `sc_consensus`: For understanding the consensus mechanism implementation
- `sc_service`: For examining how block production is coordinated
- `sc_executor`: For investigating runtime execution issues during block production
- `sc_transaction_pool`: For checking if transactions are being properly included in blocks
- The specific consensus implementation library (e.g., `sc_consensus_aura` for Aura)

## 5. Compilation targets explanation:

Node service libraries are compiled to native code only, while runtime libraries are compiled to both native and Wasm because:

1. **Execution environment differences**:
   - Node services run on the host machine and need full access to system resources
   - Runtime needs to execute in a constrained Wasm environment for on-chain upgrades

2. **Performance and capabilities**:
   - Native code is more efficient for node operations like networking and disk I/O
   - Wasm provides portability and security for the runtime

3. **Upgrade mechanics**:
   - Runtime can be upgraded on-chain via governance (requiring Wasm)
   - Node upgrades require manual updates by node operators

4. **Security boundaries**:
   - Node code has privileged access to the system
   - Runtime code executes in a sandboxed environment

5. **Determinism requirements**:
   - Runtime execution must be deterministic across all nodes
   - Node services can have non-deterministic behavior
