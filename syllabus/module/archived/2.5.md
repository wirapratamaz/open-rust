## From/Into

- Rust has a robust type system
  - More reliable & maintainable code
  - Cumbersome to work with similar & wrapper types
    - Usually requires extra repeated code
- Traits can be used to easily convert between types:
  - From
    - Convert from one type to another
  - Into
    - Convert one type into another type

---

## Traits: From/Into

- From:
  - Associated method on a type
    - TypeName::from()
  - Implementing From automatically implements Into
- Into:
  - self method on a type
    - variable.into()

---

## From/Into Example

```rust
let owned = String::from("slice");

let owned: String = "slice".into();

fn to_owned(slice: &str) -> String {
    slice.into()
}
```

---

## Implementing From

```rust
enum Status {
    Broken(u8),
    Working,
}

impl From<u8> for Status {
    fn from(code: u8) -> Self {
        match code {
            0 => Status::Working,
            c => Status::Broken(c),
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Using From/Into Implementation

```rust
// Returns a status code
fn legacy_interface() -> u8 {
    5
}

let status: Status = legacy_interface().into();
let status = Status::from(legacy_interface());
```

---

## Pro Tips

- From/Into cannot fail
- Almost always want to implement From for errors
- Prefer implementing From instead of Into
  - Into is automatically implemented with From
- Use .into() when:
  - Obvious what resulting type will be
- Use Type::from() when:
  - Important to know the resulting type

---

## Question Mark Operator

```rust
struct Job;

enum JobError {
    Expired,
    Missing,
    Other(u8),
}

impl From<u8> for JobError {
    fn from(code: u8) -> Self {
        match code {
            1 => Self::Expired,
            2 => Self::Missing,
            c => Self::Other(c),
        }
    }
}

fn execute_job(job: Job) -> Result<(), JobError> {
    Err(2)?
}
```

## Many Numeric Types

- 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 bit integers
  - Signed & unsigned
- isize & usize
  - Pointer sized numeric types
    - usize used to index into arrays
  - Depends on architecture: 16bit, 64bit, etc
- 32bit & 64bit floating point

## Literal Numeric Annotations

```rust
15u8;
-12i16;
999_usize;
13_456_019u32;
17.7f32;
```

---

## Type Safety

```rust
let whoops = 300u8;

error: literal out of range for `u8`
 --> src/bin/1.rs:17:18
  |
17 |     let whoops = 300u8;
  |                  ^^^^
  |
  = note: `#[deny(overflowing_literals)]` on by default
  = note: the literal `300u8` does not fit into the type `u8` whose range is `0..=255`
```

---

## Conversion

- Integers can be converted between types
  - u8 will always fit into a u16
    - Lossless conversion
  - u16 cannot fit into u8, but it can still be converted
    - Value will be a number in the range of the target type
- Math operations require all operands to be the same type 
  - Convert to the largest type needed

---

## Cast Syntax

```rust
let a = 15u8 as u16;
let b = a as u8 + 20u16 as u8;
```

---

## Casting to less bits

- (Source value) â€“ (Target max + 1)
  - Repeat until the value fits in the type
- Alternatively: (Source value) modulus (Target max + 1)
- This happens automatically when using as to convert

TODO

---

## Converting Floats To Integer

- Float to integer is a saturating conversion
  - The value will be clamped to the minimum or maximum of the target type
- Decimal points are truncated/dropped

TODO

---

## Checked Casting

```rust
u8::try_from(300u16)
```
