# Exercise 6: Practical Mini-Project

## Objective
Apply your knowledge of Substrate libraries to plan the development of a simple custom blockchain.

## Instructions

1. You are tasked with designing a simple custom blockchain using Substrate. This blockchain needs to:
   - Track token balances
   - Support a basic governance mechanism
   - Implement a simple consensus algorithm
   - Have potential to connect to Polkadot in the future

2. For each component of your blockchain, identify:
   - Which Substrate libraries you would use
   - Why you chose these libraries
   - How they would interact with each other

3. Create a project structure with:
   - A simple Cargo.toml for the runtime showing required dependencies
   - A simple Cargo.toml for the node showing required dependencies
   - Brief explanations of which pallets you would implement and why

4. What additional considerations would you need to make if you wanted to eventually connect this chain to Polkadot as a parachain?

5. How would you ensure your blockchain's runtime is properly optimized for Wasm execution?
