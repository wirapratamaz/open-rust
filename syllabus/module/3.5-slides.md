## WebAssembly in Substrate

- **What is WebAssembly (WASM)?**
  - Portable binary instruction format 
  - Designed for stack-based virtual machines
  - Platform-agnostic execution
  - Compiled from high-level languages (Rust, C, C++)

- **Why Substrate uses WASM?**
  - Runtime determinism across nodes
  - Security through sandboxing
  - Compact binary size
  - Near-native execution speed

Notes:
WebAssembly (WASM) is a critical component in Substrate, providing a consistent execution environment across different hardware platforms. Substrate compiles its runtime to WASM to ensure that all nodes on the network execute exactly the same state transitions, which is essential for blockchain consensus. The sandboxed environment provides security by isolating the runtime from the host system, while the compact binary size reduces blockchain bloat. Despite running in a virtual machine, WASM achieves near-native execution speeds.

## Key Benefits of WASM in Blockchain

- **Determinacy**
  - Consistent execution across different hardware
  - Essential for blockchain consensus

- **Efficiency**
  - Compact binaries reduce blockchain bloat
  - Fast execution speeds

- **Security**
  - Sandboxed execution environment
  - Isolation from host system

- **Forkless Upgradability**
  - Runtime updates without chain forks
  - Seamless evolution of blockchain logic

Notes:
The key benefits of using WebAssembly in blockchain development, particularly with Substrate, are numerous. Determinacy ensures that regardless of the hardware running a node, the same code will produce identical results - a critical requirement for blockchain consensus. WASM binaries are compact, reducing the storage requirements on the blockchain, and execute at near-native speeds for good performance. The sandboxed execution environment prevents malicious code from affecting the host system. Perhaps most importantly, WASM enables forkless upgrades, allowing blockchain runtime logic to be updated without requiring hard forks of the chain.

## WASM in Polkadot Ecosystem

- **Relay Chain**
  - Uses WASM for core runtime execution
  - Verifies parachain WASM runtimes

- **Parachains**
  - Built with Substrate
  - Compile their runtimes to WASM
  - Share security model with relay chain

- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**
  - Consistent runtime execution model
  - Predictable state transitions

Notes:
In the Polkadot ecosystem, WebAssembly plays a central role in both the relay chain and parachains. The Polkadot relay chain uses WASM for its core runtime execution and also verifies the WASM runtimes of connected parachains. Parachains, typically built with Substrate, compile their business logic to WASM, ensuring they can be validated by the relay chain as part of Polkadot's shared security model. This consistent execution model across chains enables predictable state transitions and facilitates cross-chain communication and interoperability within the ecosystem.

## The WASM Executor

- **Role**
  - Executes the runtime code
  - Chooses between native and WASM execution
  - Manages runtime version compatibility

- **Implementation**
  - Runs in a sandboxed environment
  - Uses Wasmi or Wasmtime for execution
  - Handles dispatch to runtime functions

Notes:
The WASM Executor is a crucial component in Substrate nodes, responsible for executing the runtime code. It determines whether to use the native or WASM version of the runtime based on version compatibility and execution strategy. The executor runs the WASM code in a sandboxed environment using tools like Wasmi or Wasmtime, handling the dispatch of calls to runtime functions. This separation between the node and runtime ensures security and enables the forkless upgrade capability that makes Substrate so powerful.

---

## Native vs. WASM Execution

- **Native Executor**
  - Included in node executable
  - Faster execution
  - Used when compatible with on-chain WASM runtime
  - Version matching required (`spec_name`, `spec_version`, `authoring_version`)

- **WASM Executor**
  - Canonical runtime version
  - Stored on-chain under well-known storage key (`:code`)
  - Used after runtime upgrades
  - Essential for block construction

Notes:
Substrate supports two execution environments for the runtime: native and WASM. The native executor is compiled directly into the node executable and runs at full native speed, but can only be used when it's compatible with the on-chain WASM runtime. Compatibility is checked using version fields like `spec_name`, `spec_version`, and `authoring_version`. The WASM executor runs the canonical runtime version stored on-chain, and is essential after runtime upgrades when the native runtime may be outdated. It's always used for block construction to ensure validation against the most current on-chain state.

---

## Execution Strategy

| **Strategy** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| NativeWhenPossible | Use native if compatible with WASM; otherwise, fall back to WASM |
| Wasm | Always use WASM runtime |
| Native | Always use native runtime (if compatible, no fallback) |

- Configurable for different blockchain processes
- Ensures consistent execution across network

Notes:
Substrate provides configurable execution strategies to control when the native or WASM runtime is used. The most common strategy is `NativeWhenPossible`, which uses the native runtime for performance when compatible, but falls back to the WASM runtime when necessary. The `Wasm` strategy always uses the WASM runtime regardless of native availability, while the `Native` strategy attempts to use only the native runtime with no fallback. These strategies can be configured for different blockchain processes, ensuring consistent execution across the network while balancing performance considerations.

---

## Runtime Version Compatibility

- **RuntimeVersion fields**
  - `spec_name`: Name of the runtime specification
  - `spec_version`: Version of the specification (critical)
  - `authoring_version`: Version of authoring interface
  - `impl_version`: Implementation version (less critical)

- **Version checking**
  - Ensures native executor compatibility with on-chain WASM
  - Prevents unexpected behavior after upgrades
  - Maintains network consistency

Notes:
Runtime version compatibility is checked using the `RuntimeVersion` struct, which contains fields like `spec_name`, `spec_version`, `authoring_version`, and `impl_version`. The `spec_version` is particularly critical as it indicates changes in the runtime specification that affect consensus. The executor compares these fields between the native runtime and the on-chain WASM runtime to determine compatibility. This version checking ensures that after a runtime upgrade, nodes will use the correct runtime version, preventing unexpected behavior and maintaining network consistency.

---

## Runtime Upgrades

- **Forkless upgrades**
  - Key feature of Substrate
  - Updates WASM binary on-chain
  - No need for all nodes to upgrade simultaneously

- **Upgrade process**
  - Proposal and governance approval
  - WASM binary updated at `:code` storage key
  - Executor detects version mismatch
  - Nodes switch to new WASM runtime

Notes:
One of the most powerful features of Substrate is its support for forkless runtime upgrades. This allows the blockchain's logic to be updated without requiring a hard fork or for all nodes to upgrade simultaneously. The upgrade process typically involves a proposal through the chain's governance system, which, when approved, updates the WASM binary stored at the `:code` storage key. The executor detects the version mismatch and switches to the new WASM runtime, ensuring all nodes sync with the updated logic. This capability enables blockchains to evolve over time without disrupting the network.

---

## Build Process

- **Runtime compilation**
  - Rust code compiled to WASM using `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
  - Must be `no_std` compatible
  - Optimized for size and performance

- **Node compilation**
  - Native Rust compilation
  - Includes both node services and native runtime
  - Links against standard library

- **Integration**
  - Node bundles native runtime
  - WASM runtime stored on-chain
  - Executor bridges the two

Notes:
The build process for a Substrate chain involves compiling the runtime to both native code and WASM. The runtime is compiled to WASM using the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target and must be `no_std` compatible since the WASM environment doesn't have access to the standard library. The WASM binary is optimized for size and performance. The node, on the other hand, is compiled as native Rust code and includes both the node services and a copy of the runtime compiled for native execution. The executor in the node bridges between these two execution environments, ensuring the appropriate runtime is used based on the execution strategy and version compatibility.

---

## Practical Implications

- **Development considerations**
  - Runtime must work in both native and WASM environments
  - Use `sp_std` instead of standard library
  - Test on both execution environments
  - Consider performance implications

- **Deployment considerations**
  - Initial genesis configuration
  - Runtime upgrade mechanisms
  - Governance for runtime changes
  - Backward compatibility

Notes:
When developing with Substrate, it's important to consider that the runtime will execute in both native and WASM environments. This requires using `sp_std` instead of the standard library and testing on both execution environments to ensure consistent behavior. Performance implications should be considered, as WASM execution may be slower than native. For deployment, consider the initial genesis configuration, runtime upgrade mechanisms, governance processes for runtime changes, and backward compatibility to ensure smooth transitions as the blockchain evolves over time.
