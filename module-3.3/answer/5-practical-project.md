# Answer: Practical Mini-Project

## 1. Components and libraries for a simple custom blockchain:

### Token Balances:
- **Libraries**: `pallet_balances`, `frame_support`
- **Purpose**: Manage account balances, transfers, and related operations
- **Integration**: Will be used by other pallets that need to check balances or transfer tokens

### Governance Mechanism:
- **Libraries**: `pallet_collective`, `pallet_democracy`
- **Purpose**: Enable on-chain governance for parameter changes and runtime upgrades
- **Integration**: Will interact with other pallets through origins and dispatch calls

### Consensus Algorithm:
- **Libraries**: `pallet_aura` (runtime), `sc_consensus_aura` (node)
- **Purpose**: Provide a simple round-robin block production mechanism
- **Integration**: Works with `pallet_grandpa` for block finality

### Polkadot Connectivity Preparation:
- **Libraries**: None initially, but design with potential for `cumulus_pallet_parachain_system`
- **Purpose**: Future-proof for potential parachain connection
- **Integration**: Will need to be added later with minimal disruption

## 2. Component breakdown:

### Token Balances:
- **Libraries**: `pallet_balances`, `frame_system`, `frame_support`
- **Reason**: `pallet_balances` is the standard Substrate solution for account balance management. It's well-tested, efficient, and integrates seamlessly with other pallets.
- **Interaction**: Other pallets will use it for fees, staking, and any token-related operations.

### Governance:
- **Libraries**: `pallet_collective`, `pallet_democracy`, `pallet_treasury`
- **Reason**: These provide a flexible governance system with voting, proposals, and treasury management. Using established pallets ensures security and reduces development time.
- **Interaction**: Governance decisions can affect other pallets through parameter changes or runtime upgrades.

### Consensus:
- **Libraries**: 
  - Runtime: `pallet_aura`, `pallet_grandpa`
  - Node: `sc_consensus_aura`, `sc_finality_grandpa`
- **Reason**: Aura provides simple, efficient consensus suitable for a new chain, while Grandpa provides fast finality. This combination is well-tested in Substrate.
- **Interaction**: Consensus interacts with the transaction pool, block production, and network layers.

### Future Parachain Compatibility:
- **Design Considerations**: Modular architecture, clean interfaces between pallets
- **Reason**: Keeping the design modular will make it easier to integrate parachain components later.
- **Interaction**: Will eventually need integration points for relay chain communication.

### Pallet Selections and Reasoning:

1. **pallet_balances**: Essential for managing account balances and transfers.

2. **pallet_timestamp**: Required for time-dependent logic and consensus algorithms.

3. **pallet_aura + pallet_grandpa**: Simple and efficient consensus mechanism for block production (Aura) and finality (Grandpa).

4. **pallet_collective**: Enables committee-based decision making for governance.

5. **pallet_democracy**: Provides on-chain democratic processes for referenda and proposals.

6. **pallet_treasury**: Manages a collective fund for project funding, which complements the governance system.

## 4. Parachain considerations:

To connect this chain to Polkadot as a parachain, additional considerations include:

1. **Additional Dependencies**: 
   - `cumulus_pallet_parachain_system`: Core parachain functionality
   - `cumulus_pallet_xcm`: Cross-chain messaging
   - `polkadot_parachain`: Polkadot integration
   - `xcm`: Cross-chain messaging format

2. **Architecture Changes**:
   - Replace full consensus with parachain consensus (collator-based)
   - Add collator node functionality
   - Implement XCM handlers for cross-chain communication

3. **Governance Alignment**:
   - Ensure governance processes can work with relay chain interactions
   - Consider how relay chain governance impacts your parachain

4. **Security Model Adjustments**:
   - Adapt to shared security model of Polkadot
   - Remove independent validator selection (if present)

5. **Resource Limitations**:
   - Ensure runtime respects parachain block constraints
   - Optimize weight usage for parachain blocks

## 5. Runtime optimization for Wasm:

To ensure the blockchain's runtime is properly optimized for Wasm execution:

1. **Use `no_std` Compatibility**:
   - Ensure all runtime code is `no_std` compatible
   - Use `sp_std` instead of standard library

2. **Optimize Dependencies**:
   - Use `default-features = false` for all runtime dependencies
   - Only enable std features conditionally

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Minimize memory allocations
   - Avoid recursive functions that could cause stack overflows
   - Use bounded collections instead of unbounded ones

4. **Use Performance-Optimized Cryptography**:
   - Leverage host functions via `sp_io` for cryptographic operations
   - Avoid implementing complex cryptography in runtime code

5. **Weight Optimization**:
   - Implement accurate weight calculations for all extrinsics
   - Use benchmarking to determine proper weights
   - Consider weight refunds for unused computation

6. **Storage Optimization**:
   - Minimize storage reads/writes
   - Use compact encodings for storage items
   - Implement efficient storage structures

7. **Build Configuration**:
   - Use appropriate Wasm optimization flags
   - Enable Link-Time Optimization (LTO)
   - Configure small code model for Wasm
   - Use appropriate optimization level in Cargo.toml
